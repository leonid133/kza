	Corrections
	-----------
	- Removed code generated to wait after setting VDD Monitor Enable
	  in register VDM0CN since it is enabled by default and in most
	  cases the wait is unnecessary (F50x-51x, F58x-59x).

	- Changed ADC0 property page 'Repeat Count' drop-down list control 
	  to shorten option names to prevent cutoff (F50x-51x, F52xA-53xA,
	  F58x-59x).

	- Fixed behavior of Interrupt Enable and Interrupt Priority
	  property pages to disable selections for CAN and LIN interrupts
	  for devices which do not have those peripherals (F50x-51x,
	  F58x-59x).

	- Changed behavior of Interrupt Enable and Interrupt Priority
	  property pages (F52xA-53xA) to show disabled selections for LIN
	  interrupts for devices which do not have that peripheral; this
	  is to match the behavior for similar device families.

	  property page from little-endian to big-endian to conform
	  with ports 0, 1 and 2 (F50x-51x, F58x-59x).

	- Fixed code generated for setting the OSCICN Internal Oscillator
	  Control register IOSCEN field to disable the Internal Oscillator
	  (F50x-51x, F58x-59x).

	- Fixed Port I/O Crossbar property page to disable LIN peripheral
	  selection for devices which don't have that peripheral
	  (F52xA-53xA).

	  so that code switches to the correct page (CONFIG_PAGE) before
	  the assignment and back again (to ACTIVE_PAGE) after.

	- Removed EMIF from the peripheral menus for F502, F503, F506
	  and F507, devices which do not have off-chip memory access,
	  and enhanced device-specific behavior of the property page.

	- Fixed an incorrect control reference in the F50x-51x Timer 3
	  property page which could cause a program fault.

	- Fixed F50x-51x Comparator 1 MUX settings that were being
