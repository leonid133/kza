Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

	1) Supported operating systems: Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista.

	2) When using this package with CP210x devices, you must change the default factory
	   Product ID (PID) from 0xEA60 to 0xEA61. Install the device as instructed in your
	   CP210x Development Kit along with the Virtual Serial Port Drivers. Once the device
	   is installed, use the CP210xSetIDs.exe program to change the PID to 0xEA61. Then
	   you may load the USBXpress device driver included in this package.

	4) A call to SI_GetProductString with 'Options' set to SI_RETURN_DESCRIPTION will return 
	   only the driver description string, and not the one in the device.
	
	5) When using SI_SetBaudRate with CP2101, only the valid baud rates listed in the 
	   CP2101 data sheet should be used. Attempting to use other baud rates will return 
	   SI_DEVICE_IO_FAILED.


Release Dates
-------------

	USBXpress Development Kit v3.1.1a - September 12, 2007


Revision History
-----------------

version 3.1.1a
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	- Added a 64 bit version of the SiUSBXp.DLL library.

	Corrections
	-----------
	- Corrected to not allow the DLL to clean up an open handle on a thread detach.


version 3.1.1
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------	
	- Updated Visual C++ 6.0 Test Panel example source to correctly handle open/close and
	  timeouts.
	  
	- Added Visual C# .NET 2005 Test Panel example source code.
	

version 3.1
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------	
	- Updated Driver for Vista and re-certified through Winqual for 2K/XP/S2K3/Vista(x86/x64)

	- Updated the USBXpress Driver Installer to version 2.0 which includes Vista.

	- Added two functions to the DLL, SI_GetDriverVersion and SI_GetDLLVersion.


version 3.0.5
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Corrected SI_CheckRXQueue so that the correct number of bytes is returned, and is
	a meaningful value. The flags are also confirmed for this function.

	- Addressed blue screen issue for surprise removal of USBXpress device that is connected
	and opened.

	- Updated the USBXpress Installer to version 1.5. This eliminates rare Windows 2K errors
	which claim that the driver cannot be uninstalled.
	

version 3.0.4
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	- Modified the driver to pend multiple I/O requests.

	- SI_Read now allows reads to complete with less than the data requested, as long as
	there are more than 0 bytes. Check the buffer length returned from the SI_Read function
	to determine the exact number of bytes that are returned.

	Corrections
	-----------
	- Updated the USBXpress Installer to version 1.4. This eliminates errors when trying
	to install/uninstall read-only files.


version 3.0.3
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Modfied SI_Read and SI_Write to cancel IO operations that timeout or fail.

	- Corrected a bug in the driver which returns an incorrect amount of bytes for SI_Read.

	- Changed the return value when SI_Read is called for a second time and the first
	SI_Read is still pending, it will show up as a system error.


version 3.0.1
	Corrections
	-----------
	- Corrected the DLL Thread/Process Detach functionality to call the updated version of
	SI_Close.

	- Changed the default DLL Timeout values to be infinite instead of 0. This prevents timeouts
	occurring on current code, and makes calls the do not set any timeouts to be synchronous
	but non-blocking.


version 3.0
	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	- This verison of the driver is certifiable, and has been certified for XP and
	Server 2003.

	- SI_Read is no longer a blocking call. The interface now has an added overlapped
	object parameter that can be passed to the function. Otherwise, old code will work
	because the parameter defaults to NULL. If it is NULL, then the SI_Read function
	will not block, and performs the wait inside of the SiUSBXp.DLL.

	- A new installation utility has been introduced which will clear old installations
	to always successfully upgrade the Driver to the latest version. This new utility
	can be customized without breaking the driver's certification.
	
	Corrections
	-----------
	- SI_GetProductString was fixed so that the requested string is correctly returned.

	- SI_Open change to return INVALID_PARAMATER instead of the incorrect INVALID_HANLDE_VALUE
	whenever an invalid HANDLE pointer is provided.

	
version 2.42
	Corrections
	-----------
	'USBXpress Host API
		Fixed the constant SI_WRITE_FAILED return when USING SI_Write();

Version 2.41
	Corrections
	-----------
	'USBXPress Host API:
		Wrong build of the Interface DLL replaced with the correct build.

Version 2.4

	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	No changes to host-side driver and DLL; version numbers incremented to v2.4.
	'F3xx firmware libraries:
		USBX_F320_1.LIB firmware library is compatible with 'F320/1 and 'F34x devices.
		Added FileTransfer and TestPanel examples for 'F34x devices - please note that 
		these examples are the same as those for 'F32x device because those devices 
		are code-compatible.
		
		Added new firmware library for C8051F326/7 devices (USBX_F326_7.LIB).
		Added FileTransfer example for C8051F326/7 devices.
		If you are porting an existing application from 'F320/1 to 'F326/7, please note
		that these two families are not exactly code-compatible. See the device 				datasheets for more details.

		Added function USB_Get_Library_Version to library that returns a 2-byte BCD
		value (0x0241=2.41); Previously, the only way to determine the version was by
		the file date.

	Corrections
	-----------
	'F320/1 firmware library:
		Fixed issue in v2.3 library that ignored a IN endpoint halt command.


Version 2.31


Version 2.3

	New Features/Enhancements
	-------------------------
	Application Note AN169 has been updated from Revision 1.5 to Revision 1.6:

	'F320/1 firmware library:
		Library renamed from USB_API.LIB to USBX_F320_1.LIB
		USB_Clock_Start() function added to improve flexibility.
	See UpgradeNotes.txt for steps to upgrade existing applications.

	Corrections
	-----------
	Added GetPartNumber support for CP2101.
	Close function now sets a handle passed by reference to INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE.
	Updated invalid handle and invalid parameter checks in the API.
	'F320/1 firmware library:
		Fixed USB_Disable() hang issue.
		Eliminated unnecessary delay in Block_Write() when sending a zero-length packet.
		Corrected USB clock startup code to check if clock multiplier is already enabled.
		Removed default values for USB_Init() parameters to save code space; NULL cannot 
		be used any more to choose defaults.
