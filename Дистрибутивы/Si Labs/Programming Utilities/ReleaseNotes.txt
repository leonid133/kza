KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS
----------------------------
	
    1. To enable the USB Debug Adapter functionality in an application the 
       USB debug adapter driver file must be present (USBHID.DLL).

    2. Command-Line Utility
	a. FLASHUtilCL.exe is a Windows command prompt program and cannot 
             be used in DOS.
	b. SiUtil.dll must be in the same directory as FLASHUtilCL.exe.
	c. USBHID.dll must be in the same directory as FLASHUtilCL.exe.

    3. Windows Console Utility: 
	a. SiUtil.dll must be in the same directory as FLASHUtil.exe.
	b. USBHID.dll must be in the same directory as FLASHUtil.exe.

    4. Dynamic DLL
	a. The dynamically linked build of the Utilities DLL requires that
           files "MFC42.dll" and "MSVCRT.dll" be present on the target 
           machine. This is not a problem if the client program is 
           dynamically linked to the same version (Version 4.2) or newer 
           of the MFC library (i.e. uses MFC as a shared library). The 
           required MFC DLLs are provided with this release along with the 
           dynamically linked MFC version of the Utilities DLL. Do not 
           replace equivalent or newer version of these files if they are 
           already present on the target machine.
	b. USBHID.dll must be present to communicate with a USB Debug Adaper.

    5. The FLASH Programming Utilities install by default to the 
       "C:\SiLabs\MCU\Utilities\Flash Programming" directory.

    6. Corresponding with Programming Utilities release 2.3 is a change in 
       installation strategy. This release will now be compatible with the 
       release downloaded from www.silabs.com. Due to this change, release 
       2.3 will not recognize previous installations. The new installation 
       will overwrite any existing files if installed to the same location 
       as a previous installion. Attempting to uninstall a previous 
       installation will affect the new installation if located in the 
       same directory.
